The corrected code simply removes the invalid class or replaces it with a valid one.

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 bg-blue-500">
</div>
```

This version directly applies the `bg-blue-500` class, avoiding the `@apply` directive for this specific case.  If you need to reuse `bg-blue-500`, create a custom CSS class instead of using `@apply` to enforce better maintainability.

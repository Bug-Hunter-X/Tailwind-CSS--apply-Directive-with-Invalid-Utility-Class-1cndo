# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive with Invalid Utility Class

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Tailwind CSS involving the `@apply` directive and an invalid or misspelled utility class.  The error is subtle because it doesn't always produce a clear error message; instead, it can lead to unpredictable styling issues.

## The Problem

The `@apply` directive is a powerful feature in Tailwind, allowing you to abstract reusable styles. However, if you use `@apply` with a class that isn't defined in your Tailwind configuration or has a typo, it will silently fail. This can be hard to debug, as the visual results may not immediately indicate the problem.

## Reproduction

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code, demonstrating the use of `@apply` with a non-existent class.  Compare this with the corrected version in `bugSolution.html`.

## Solution

The solution is to carefully check the spelling and existence of all utility classes used within the `@apply` directive.  Refer to your Tailwind CSS configuration and documentation to ensure that the classes are correctly defined and spelled.
